This repository contains solutions to _simple_ "how to" problems in `tkinter`, 
that is problems you would ask help about my asking questions that start with 
"how to".

The folder `widgets` contains examples of solutions to "how to" problems related 
only to specific widgets. For example, in `widgets/Text` we can find the file
[`style_parts_of_text.py`](widgets/Text/style_parts_of_text.py), which basically 
contains an  example of a solution on how to style certain parts of text (or 
simple words) in a `Text` widget.

Every file is intended to contain solutions to one single problem. Examples are 
concise. Each module's doc-strings contains a list of the references used while
implementing the example.
