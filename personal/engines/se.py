This module contains a class SE, which represents a Search Engine.
All methods in SE are static, and therefore can be accessed through the following syntax:
                            SE.method(args)
I put all functions in a class because I am a fan of the object oriented-paradigm.
The pair of indices returned is composed of: [starting_index, index_after_last_char]
For example, if the indices for the word 'are' in the string 'How are you"
would be: [4, 7] (7 is the index past the last letter)
Keep in mind indices start from 0.

Names conventions (of "SE"):
Methods that finish with "_re" were created specifically to search regular expressions.

All methods that start with "next_" have an optional parameter called "start",
which represents the index from where to start the search.

All methods that start with "full_" will return just indices of entire words (and not sub strings).
Note that these functions consider "you?" different from "you"!

More generic powerful functions are found at the end. Rawer simple functions are found at the beginning.

TODO:
 - performance of the algorithms has not been optimized...
 - I might not need both the functions that starts from a certain index
 and the function that simply returns everything.
 For example, maybe I just need "next_occurrences_re" instead of "occurrences_re",
 since the first can also do everything that the second does.

    """Search Engine for my Editor,
    but it can also be used for other projects,
    since methods were thought to be as flexible as possible

    PARAMETERS:
    :param substring: "substring" to search in "string"
    :param string: the "string" where to search the "substring"
    :param sensitive: if True, does not ignore the case: "WORD" is different from "word",
    else it's ignored: "WORD" is considered equals to "word".
    :param overlapping: if True, possible sub strings are also searched, and not just entire words.
    :param pattern: regular expression to search in "string"
    :param word: entire word to search in "string".
    This is the same thing as passing to "pattern" or "substring", when "overlapping" is False.
    :param regexp: if True, it will use functions that end with "_re

    Note that functions that end with "_re" ignore what is case sensitive.
